# Action Recognition Zoo
Codes for popular action recognition models, written based on pytorch, verified on the [something-something](https://www.twentybn.com/datasets/something-something) dataset. This code is built on top of the [TRN-pytorch](https://github.com/metalbubble/TRN-pytorch).

**Note**: always use git clone --recursive https://github.com/coderSkyChen/Action_Recognition_Zoo to clone this project Otherwise you will not be able to use the inception series CNN architecture.

## Requires
- Opencv-2.4.13 or some greater version that has tvl1 api for the computing of optical flow.
- Pytorch-0.2.0_3
- Tensorflow-1.3.1ï¼Œthis is only for the using of tensorboard, it's ok without this, but you need to comment the corresponding codes.

## Data preparation
### Dataset
- **Download** the [something-something](https://www.twentybn.com/datasets/something-something) dataset. Decompress them into some folder.
- Note that this dataset contains 108,499 videos and each video is presented in JPG images. The JPG images were extracted from the orginal videos at 12 frames per seconds.
- The temporal evolution in videos is important for this dataset, so it's hard for some classic models such as: Two-Stream Convolutional Networks for Action Recognition in Videos, NIPS 2014.
### Prepare optical flow using TVL1 algorithm
Since there only rgb frames in the official dataset, we need compute optical flow by ourselves.

I use the tvl1 api in Opencv-2.4.13.
